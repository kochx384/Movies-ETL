# Movies ETL
## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. Data from multiple data sets are merged and transformed into a clean dataset, which is then loaded into a SQL database. The automated pipeline will allow the data to be able to be updated automatically.
